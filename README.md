# B546 Final Project: Testing Tesla's Vision

This repo is a loose collection of code and other related files to complete my B546 project for the Fall 2020 semester. The object of this project is to evaluate if I can prove Tesla vehicles have a weakness to adversarial examples.

Using Detectron 2, COCO Data Format, And Instance Segmentation

Detectron2 https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2 
COCO https://cocodataset.org/#home

I built everything using the tools, resources, and guides below.

Webcrawler to download images:
